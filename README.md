### Restaurant App Onboarding Section

Welcome to the onboarding section of our restaurant app! This guide will help you understand how to sign up, log in, complete OTP authentication, and undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. We are committed to ensuring a smooth and secure onboarding process for our users.

### Sign Up
The sign-up process is the first step to enjoy the full benefits of our restaurant app. Follow these steps:

### OTP Authentication
To enhance the security of your account, we use OTP (One-Time Password) authentication. Here's how to set it up:

- After logging in, go to your account settings.
- Enable OTP authentication.
- A unique OTP will be sent to your registered email or phone number each time you log in.
- Enter the OTP within the specified time to access your account.

### KYC Verification
As part of our commitment to safety and security, we require KYC verification for certain features of our app. Follow these steps:

- In your account settings, find the "KYC Verification" section.
- Provide the required information and documents, such as a valid ID and a recent utility bill.
- Wait for our team to review your KYC submission. This typically takes a short amount of time.
